Apache Calcite Avatica 1.15.0 is a small release that fixes a regression causing
error messages to not be propagated to clients. There is also a minor update to the
docker release script to automate the upload of release artifacts and build promotion.
See the list of [bug fixes and new features]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/history.html#v1-15-0)
for more information.

Consumers of Avatica are encouraged to skip the 1.14.0 release and upgrade directly to
1.15.0 due to the aforementioned regression.
